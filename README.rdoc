= SomaticsFilter

Somatics Filter aims to enable record filtering in the admin panel. It is easy-to-use, database- and 
platform-independent. Somatics Filter is now compatible with Rails 2 and Rails 3

== Getting Started

1. Installation
    # Rails 2:
    # In environment.rb, add
    config.gem 'searchlogic'
    
    # Rails 3:
    # In Gemfile
    gem 'meta_search'

    script/plugin install git://github.com/timcharper/calendar_date_select.git
    script/plugin install git://github.com/inspiresynergy/somatics_filter.git
2. Specify available filters in model
    # We have the model
    Post(id: integer, title: string, content: text, date: date, show: boolean, state: string)

    # Add filter is easy (Add to post.rb)
    has_filter :id, :integer
    has_filter :title, :string
    has_filter :content, :text
    has_filter :date, :date
    has_filter :show, :boolean
    has_filter :state, :list, :values => ['Draft', 'Posted', 'Closed']
3. Accept and apply query in controller
    # In PostsController
    def index
      @posts = Post.apply_query(params).paginate(:page => params[:page])
      # Some other codes
    end
4. Render the filter form in view
    # In index.html.erb
    <%= somatics_filter_for :post %>
5. Enjoy!

== Advanced Use Cases
    # Supported Filter Types: :integer, :float, :string, :text, :boolean, :list, :date, :custom

    # List Filter: Allow User to select the matching value
    has_filter :state, :list, :values => ['New', 'Drafted', 'Published']

    # Default Filter: Filters that are set as default
    # e.g. Filter Records with ID > 2 by default
    has_filter :id, :integer, :default => true, :default_operator => 'gt', :default_value => '2'

    # Custom Filter: Apply the named scope defined
    scope :available, where(:state => 'available')
    has_filter :available, :custom

== Dependency

SomaticsFilter depends on the use of searchlogic/meta_search and calandar_date_select.
* <b>Searchlogic</b>: http://github.com/binarylogic/searchlogic
* <b>MetaSearch</b>: http://github.com/ernie/meta_search
* <b>CalendarDateSelect</b>: http://github.com/timcharper/calendar_date_select

SomaticsFilter can be used with SomaticsGenerator which handles all the front-end code generations.
The only things needed to do is setting the available filters.
